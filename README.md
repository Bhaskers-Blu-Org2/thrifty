Thrifty
=======

"It's like Thrift, but cheaper"

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/benjamin-bader/thrifty.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/benjamin-bader/thrifty)

Thrift is super cool, with a nifty interface definition language from which to generate types and RPC implementations.
Unfortunately for Android devs, the canonical implementation generates very verbose and method-heavy Java code, in a manner
that is not very Proguard-friendly.

Like Wire for Protocol Buffers, Thrifty does away with getters and setters (and is-set and set-is-setters) in favor of public final fields.  It
maintains the core abstractions like Transport and Protocol, but saves on methods by only generating TupleProtocol-compatible
adapters if configured to do so (not yet implemented).

Code generation for everything but services is complete.  If you are not using services, Thrifty is usable today for serializing
and deserializing Thrifts.  Services are coming as soon as runtime support is ironed out.

### Usage

In `build.gradle`:

```groovy
repositories {
  mavenCentral()

  // For snapshot builds
  maven { url https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }
}

dependencies {
  compile 'com.bendb.thrifty:thrifty-runtime:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT'
}
```

On the command line:

```bash
java -jar thrifty-compiler.jar --out=path/to/output file_one.thrift file_two.thrift file_n.thrift
```

### Building

```bash
./gradlew build
```

### Testing

```bash
./gradlew check
```

### Deploying

```bash
./gradlew uploadArchives
```

You will need to have valid Sonatype Nexus OSS credentials, as well as a valid *and published* GPG signing key, configured in your local `gradle.properties` file.

Certain utilities borrowed (TType, BinaryProtcol) from the official Apache Thrift implementation
